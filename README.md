    <h1>Indian Crime Data Analysis</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involves <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> on Indian crime reports from 2019 to 2024. The goal is to uncover key insights, patterns, and trends related to crime incidents across various cities, age groups, genders, and time periods. The analysis provides a deeper understanding of the types of crimes, their distribution, and trends over time.</p>

    <h2>Key Insights from EDA</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Crime reports have remained stable, except for 2024, which has fewer reports due to incomplete data.</li>
        <li>Delhi has the highest crime rate, while cities like Lucknow report fewer cases.</li>
        <li>The <strong>10-20 age group</strong> is the most affected, showing higher vulnerability among younger populations.</li>
        <li>Females are more frequently victims across most cities and crime types, highlighting social risks.</li>
        <li>Knives are the most commonly used weapon in violent crimes.</li>
        <li>50% of the cases are still pending resolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Conduct multivariate analysis to investigate more complex relationships between variables.</li>
        <li>Develop machine learning models to predict future crime trends.</li>
